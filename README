This program was completed using pair programming.
 Partner: Max Hufft	 mhufft@ucsc.edu
 Partner: Carl Eadler ceadler@ucsc.edu

 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
 at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

 Max spent _0___ hours working alone.
 Carl spent __0__ hours working alone.
 We spent __6__ hours working together.
 Max spent _3___ hours driving.
 Carl spent __3__ hours driving.
